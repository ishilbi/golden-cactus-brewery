      Our historic, open-air warehouse was originally a soda bottling factory
      for Royal Crown Cola in the 1950's. Used primarily for industrial storage
      throughout the latter half of the 20th century, the building was bought by
      three Virginia Tech college graduates who saw the potential for a great
      addition to downtown Roanoke's craft-beer scene. Located on the corner of
      5th St and Salem Ave, Golden Cactus Brewing opened for business in August
      of 2020. Despite pandemic conditions, our dedicated staff and growing
      community of regulars supported the breweryâ€™s growth and establishment as
      one of Roanoke's favorite destinations for beer, pinball, plants, and good
      vibes.
